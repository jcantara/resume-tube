# resume-tube
Resume youtube videos and playlists where you left off. 

This is a Meteor JS project to resume youtube playlists where I left off in them, because YouTube doesn't do this by default for whatever reason, and I keep losing track of where I am in long playlists and long videos.

This is completely a POC right now, is very terribly organized and is basically just to see if it could be done. This represents a grand total of a couple of hours of hacking and I'm a bit rusty with Meteor on top of it. 

I plan on fleshing this out into something usable by "the general public" and hosting it somewhere so people can make use of it without having to self-host.
